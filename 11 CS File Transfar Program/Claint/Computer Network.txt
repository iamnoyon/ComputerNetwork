In a distributed system the collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single coherent system .
In distributed processing instated of one large machine being responsible for all aspects of a process ,
 separate computers handle a subset. Often a layer  of software on the top of operating system ,
called middleware is responsible for  implementing this model.
©	Logical Address:
    Logical address necessary for universal communication that are independent of underlying Physical network. 
Physical addresses are not adequate in an internetwork where multiple networks are involved in single data transection
 and also these networks can have different addressing format and different hosts under different network could have 
copy of same address.

Logical address is  an universal addressing system which identifies each host uniquely ,regardless of the underlying
 physical network .and often known as IP address

A Logical address in the internet  is currently a 32-bit address .No tow publicly addressed and visible  
host on the internet  can have same a IP address.

©	Port  Address:
                 Ports in networking  acts like sockets on a multiplug. nowadays  computers can run multiple
 processes t the same time and while sharing resources (both information or device) with other computer on the
 network  it needs dedicated socket for each unique process to establish  and complete the communication procedure .
For  these processes to receive data simultaneously, we need  a method to assign different  destination or label . 
In TCP/IP protocol the label assigned to a process is called port address .

In TCP/IP a port address is defined by 16 bit

                                0753 hex digit code.
