A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a
set of programs to access those data. The collection of data, usually referred to as the
database, contains information relevant to an enterprise. The primary goal of a DBMS
is to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient
and efficient.
Database systems are designed to manage large bodies of information. Management
of data involves both defining structures for storage of information and providing
mechanisms for the manipulation of information. In addition, the database
system must ensure the safety of the information stored, despite system crashes or
attempts at unauthorized access. If data are to be shared among several users, the
system must avoid possible anomalous results.
Because information is so important in most organizations, computer scientists
have developed a large body of concepts and techniques for managing data. These
concepts and technique form the focus of this book. This chapter briefly introduces
the principles of database systems..
