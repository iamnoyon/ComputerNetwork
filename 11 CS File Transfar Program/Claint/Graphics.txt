Visible light (commonly referred to simply as light) is electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye,
 and is responsible for the sense of sight.
             Electromagnetic radiation has a dual nature as both particles and waves. One way to look at it is as 
changing electric and magnetic fields which propagate through space, forming an electromagnetic wave, [Illustration].
 This wave has amplitude, which is the brightness of the light, wavelength, which is the color of the light, and an 
angle at which it is vibrating, called polarization .This was the classical interpretation, crystallized in Maxwell's
 Equations,

           In terms of the modern quantum theory, electromagnetic radiation consists of particles called photons,
 which are packets ("quanta") of energy which move at the speed of light. In this particle view of light, the brightness
 of the light is the number of photons, the color of the light is the energy contained in each photon,
 and four numbers (X, Y, Z and T) are the polarization.


           Visible light has a wavelength in the range of about  from of 7x10-5 cm (red) to 4x10-5 cm (violet) ,
 between the invisible  infrared, with longer wavelengths and the invisible  ultraviolet, with shorter wavelengths. 

         Primary properties of visible light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum,
 and polarization , while its speed in a vacuum, 299,792,458 meters per second (about 300,000 kilometers per second), 
is one of the fundamental constants of nature. Visible light, as with all types of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) is
 experimentally found to move at exactly this same speed in vacuum.
