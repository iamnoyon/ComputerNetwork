When we communicate, we are sharing information. This sharing can be local or remote. 
Between individuals, local communication usually occurs face to face, while remote communication takes place over distance. 
The term telecommunication, which includes telephony, telegraphy, and television, means communication at a distance
 (tele is Greek for "far").
The word data refers to information presented in whatever form is agreed upon by the parties creating and using the data.
